# My To-Do List Application

## Overview

A client-side To-Do List application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application provides a clean, modern interface for task management with features including task creation, completion tracking, priority levels, search functionality, and filtering options. The application uses local storage for data persistence and follows a class-based JavaScript architecture pattern.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Built entirely with vanilla web technologies without frameworks
- **Class-based JavaScript**: Uses ES6 class syntax with a `TodoApp` class as the main controller
- **Component-based UI**: Modular sections for task input, controls, statistics, and task display
- **Event-driven architecture**: Implements event delegation and centralized event handling

### Data Management
- **Local Storage**: Client-side persistence using browser's localStorage API
- **In-memory state**: Tasks array maintained in JavaScript for real-time operations
- **Auto-save**: Automatic persistence on every task modification

### UI/UX Design Patterns
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with flexible layouts
- **Modern CSS**: Uses CSS Grid/Flexbox, gradients, and box shadows for visual appeal
- **Interactive feedback**: Dynamic statistics, filter states, and search highlighting
- **Progressive enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript dependencies

### Task Management Features
- **Priority system**: Three-tier priority levels (low, medium, high)
- **Real-time filtering**: Dynamic task filtering by status (all, pending, completed)
- **Search functionality**: Live search through task descriptions
- **Statistics tracking**: Real-time counters for total, completed, and pending tasks

## External Dependencies

### Browser APIs
- **localStorage API**: For client-side data persistence
- **DOM API**: For dynamic content manipulation and event handling

### No External Libraries
- Pure vanilla JavaScript implementation
- No CDN dependencies or package managers
- Self-contained CSS styling without frameworks
- No build tools or compilation steps required

The application is designed to run entirely in the browser without any server-side components or external service dependencies.
